## About

An [Orchard Core](https://www.orchardcore.net/) module for integrating with the digital asset management platform [Bynder](https://www.bynder.com/en/). Foremost, it provides the Bynder Field content field that can be added to content parts so Bynder resources can be browsed and attached.


## Configuration

You need to configure your Bynder Portal's URL to be used in all Bynder Fields via the `BynderOptions`, see its definition. See [the Orchard docs](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/docs/reference/core/Configuration/index.html) for more info on how such configuration works.

Bynder Field can be configured like any other fields in the content type editor.
